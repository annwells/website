bio: Hi, I'm Ann! I am a postdoctoral associate at The Jackson Laboratory in Dr. Gregory Carter's Lab. I am a wet lab scientist turned computational genecist interested in dissecting complex traits in order to identify how gene-by-environment interactions either inhibit or enhance complex disease states, such as autoimmune disease and Alzheimer's disease.

Hi! I'm Ann and this is my website. I am a postdoctoral associate at the Jackson Laboratory working with Dr. Gregory Carter. I am interested in developing new statistical tools and methods to integrate multi-omics data in an unbiased way. I am also interested in applying these methods to investigate complex diseases, particularly autoimmune diseases, and determine how gene by environment interact to develop disease. In addition to my research interests, I have a passion for data reproducibility and shareability, as well as empowering non-computational biologists to obtain the computational skills necessary to perform preliminary analyses on their own data. I do this through teaching and have also become a software carpentry instructor. When I'm not thinking about science I am often riding my bike on the beautiful park loop in Acadia National Park, going for hikes, working out, or generally enjoying the amazing island I live on."
